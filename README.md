CapSense clickâ„¢ add-on board features a capacitive sensing module CY8C201A0 which 
takes human body capacitance as an input and directly provides the real time sensor 
information via I2C output. The board contains capacitive sensing elements 
(5-segment slider and two buttons) as well as two LEDs. The CY8C201A0 capacitive 
controller has high immunity against radiated and conductive noise. The board is 
designed to use 3.3V or 5V power supply. This is determined by the position of SMD 
jumper J1.
